# dust_wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet built on AlephZero blockchain.

This will be a simple cryptocurrency built with Rust smart contracts on the AlephZero blockchain. The wallet will have all the functionality for usage of a cryptocurrency, as well as the ability to scan a QR code and pay for something at a payment turnstile. Also, the app version will have support for Nova wallet as well as 'tap to pay' at a turnstile.

The simple design of the web app and app versions will be agreeable to users, and the fact that it is a cryptocurrency without a fixed price (not a 'stablecoin'), makes using it as a currency more interesting. The price my fluctuate, but if the user keeps just a couple hundred $ dollars in their dust_wallet, they can easily pay for something at a turnstile without having to worry about the price action. Also, as an asset, it may be valuable to simply buy and hold.

A unique aspect of dust (symbol ẟ, as in this costs ẟ14.97), is that the user has the option in the (open source) wallet to partition a percentage % of each transaction to the dust_vault. Each month, at the end of the month, 50% of the dust_vault will be donated to charity or a worthy cause of some kind.

The premine will be vested for 2 years, allocated to the developers who made the project. They will not be able to access or sell their premine for a minimum of 2 years (no rug pulls, thankyou very much :))
